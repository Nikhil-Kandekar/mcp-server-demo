GitHub Login for MCP ServerThis project provides an automated GitHub login and authentication mechanism for a Minecraft Community Project (MCP) server. It uses Playwright to handle the browser-based login flow, ensuring a secure and seamless authentication experience for server members.The application serves as an intermediary service, automating the process of obtaining a user's GitHub authentication token and passing it to the server for verification, thus simplifying the process of user registration and access control.FeaturesAutomated GitHub Login: Uses Playwright to programmatically log into GitHub.Secure Authentication: Handles OAuth flow to obtain user tokens without exposing credentials.Server Integration: Designed to be easily integrated with an existing MCP server's authentication system.Easy Setup: Requires minimal configuration to get up and running.PrerequisitesTo run this project, you need the following installed on your system:Node.js (version 14 or higher)npm or yarnInstallationClone the repository:git clone [https://github.com/Nikhil-Kandekar/mcp-server-demo.git](https://github.com/Nikhil-Kandekar/mcp-server-demo.git)
cd mcp-server-demo
Install the dependencies:npm install
# or
yarn install
Configure Environment Variables:Create a .env file in the root directory of the project with your GitHub credentials and any other required configurations.GITHUB_USERNAME=your_github_username
GITHUB_PASSWORD=your_github_password
Note: Storing credentials in a .env file is for local development and demonstration purposes only. For production environments, consider using a more secure method for handling secrets, such as a dedicated secret management service.UsageStart the server:npm start
# or
yarn start
The server will typically start on http://localhost:3000 (or another port specified in the code).Trigger the login flow:Access the login endpoint via your browser or an API call. The server will then use Playwright to open a headless browser, perform the GitHub login, and handle the authentication process.Server Integration:Once the authentication is successful, the server can use the retrieved information to create a new user session or verify an existing one on your MCP server.Technologies UsedNode.js: The backend runtime environment.Express.js: A fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js.Playwright: A reliable library for browser automation that enables the headless GitHub login.dotenv: A zero-dependency module that loads environment variables from a .env file.ContributingFeel free to open an issue or submit a pull request if you'd like to contribute to this project.LicenseThis project is licensed under the MIT License.
